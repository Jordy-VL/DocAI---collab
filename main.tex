\section{Introduction}

\subsubsection{Motivation}

Find a topic in document AI (DocAI) which serves our joint interests and warrants a collaboration.

\subsubsection{Context}

Major challenges in DocAI include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item business value lies in confidently and correctly predicting page classification - KIE - LIE; no standard evaluation methodology between providers
    \item absence of high-quality opensource datasets that extend to multi-page documents
    \begin{itemize}
        \item requires sample-efficient to few-shot approaches for KIE under data scarcity 
    \end{itemize}
    \item current language modeling overly focused on unstructured wikipedia-like text (Commoncrawl only has <0.5\% pdfs)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item structured text contains entities which are not always retrievable by context; more by layout or relative positioning
        \item could enhance input text with entity/pattern annotations \citep{paolini2021structured, qian-etal-2021-structural,ye2021pack}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Related Work}

\citep{cui2021document} makes a survey on the field of DocAI, contains references to some lesser known datasets.

\citep{rossum2022practicalbenchmarks} ask a similar question on practical DocAI benchmarks under opensource data scarcity, proposes synthetic generation with rich layout diversity (in future work).

The DUE benchmark \citep{borchmann2021due} consists of available and reformulated datasets to measure the end-to-end capabilities of DocAI systems.

\section{Meeting notes}

\subsection{10-06-2022}

General discussion on three ideas for papers. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Joint document image classification \&  KIE
    \begin{itemize}
        \item add explicit objective function for joint top-1 calibration 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Sample-efficient KIE with pattern-minded Transformers for reducing annotation costs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Intuition: "If you know how to predict an invoicenumber, predicting a ...number" should not be hard
        \item current subword tokenization treats KIE entities poorly, remediate by including "pattern embeddings"
        \item pretrain-then-finetune paradigm yet try to treat by finetuning-only early fusion, replacing first encoder (common in CV) and decision layer
        \item might require specific optimization scheme focused on novel parameters (cf. layer-wise adaptive learning rate, gradual unfreezing)
        \item Problem: opensource dataset which has very patternlike entities to be extracted
    \end{itemize}
    \item A comparison tool for out-of-the-box performance on domain-specific data [API caller meets DUE].
    \begin{itemize}
        \item As a potential buyer of a DocAI solution, I would like to compare the out-of-the-box offering on my test dataset ASAP
        \item Create a frictionless experience, build translators from their scheme to open APIs like Azure, Google Cloud, Amazon Textract, ...
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
